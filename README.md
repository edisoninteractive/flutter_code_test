# code_test

## Welcome to the Edison Interactive Flutter Code Test.app
This test is meant to give us a sample of what you can do with Flutter.

### The brief
We would like an app that works well on Android, iOS, and Web. Within this app
we would like you to create multiple pages to manage cars. You should show a list
of all the cars inputted into the system. Be able to edit those cars and add new ones.
There should also be a page to show its Lat/Long on a map.

When creating a new vehicle there are the normal items like; Make, Model, Color, Year, Odometer,
Lat/Long.

## Project Assessment
The project is meant to look into Flutter basics like; State management, page management, routing on web,
and the use of pub.dev packages.

 - We are not requiring that this app looks like a production ready app.

 We will be looking at how the project files get structured and the cleanness of the code. Use industry standards
 for these items.
